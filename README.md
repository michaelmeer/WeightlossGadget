##Weight Screen Ideas:
Before input is done for current day: show current actual weight / current trend weight, and name & date
When inputting: Just show current number, blinking. Maybe name, date
Wenn done with input:
* while still working, show blinking LED
* when done, show current actual weight / current trend weight. And name & date. Maybe green / red LEDs for weight loss / gain

On separate screens:
* Screen with numbers;
** Starting weight
** Loss since start
** Loss last month
* Chart of last 30 days
* Chart of last year?

To do for first version:
- Make sure I can upload daily measurements and there's no issue when I have gaps in coverage
- Make a picture, and annotate it with Name / Date / Weight

Later:
- Upload picture to Google Drive / Photos
- Graph of Measurements
- Use the Blinkt LEDs
